# YelpCamp - Web Development Bootcamp Final Project

This is the final project I completed as part of Colt Steele's [Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) course on Udemy. YelpCamp is a platform that enables users to both create and review campgrounds, as well as share their experiences with fellow users. To engage in campground-related activities such as creating new listings or posting reviews, users are required to have an active account.
